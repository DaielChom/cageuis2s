# HONOR CODE #

- group members will share code and discoveries with the rest of the team by populating their respective folder.
- submissions to Kaggle by members **MUST** be done under the Kaggle team **CAGE UIS** and reported under the `submissions` repository folder.
- the contribution of each member will be measured according to his activity in the repository and the effort estimated to produce it.

# Best practices #
- label your graphs
- include short, meaningful comments, variable and function names, etc.
- avoid cells with looooong output (write code to summarize it)
